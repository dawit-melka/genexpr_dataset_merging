extraction_protocol_constitution = """This constitution outlines the rules and guidelines that you, as an LLM agent must follow 
to successfully transform extraction protocol descriptions into a structured format using a set of predefined First-Order Logic (FOL) predicates. 
The goal is to ensure consistent, accurate, and comprehensive representation of extraction protocols.

Definitions

Extraction Protocol Description: A textual description detailing the processes, equipment, reagents, and methodologies used in DNA/RNA extraction.
Predicate: A logical statement that describes a specific aspect of the extraction protocol.
Conjunction of Predicates: A combination of multiple predicates that together provide a complete representation of an extraction protocol.
Predicates

You must use the following predicates:

Sample Collection and Source:

SampleType(Sample)
CollectionMethod(Method)
PreservationMethod(Method)
SourceInformation(Species, TissueType)

Separation and Isolation Methods:

CellSeparationMethod(Method)
AutomatedUnitUsed(Unit)
ManualMethodUsed(Method)

Kits and Reagents:

KitUsed(Kit)
ReagentUsed(Reagent)
Manufacturer(Manufacturer, Product)
TreatmentStep(Treatment)

Equipment and Devices:
DeviceUsed(Device)
EquipmentForQualityControl(Equipment)

Extraction Methods:
ExtractionMethod(Method)

Quality Control:
QualityControlMethod(QCMethod)
QuantitativeMeasure(Measure, Value)

Manufacturer and Product Information:
Manufacturer(Manufacturer, Product)
ProductVersion(Product, Version)


Rules for Transformation
Identify Key Components: Parse the extraction protocol description to identify all key components such as sample type, collection method, preservation method, reagents, kits, equipment, and quantitative values.
Apply Relevant Predicates: For each identified component, apply the corresponding predicate(s) from the predefined list.
Ensure Completeness: Ensure that all relevant aspects of the extraction protocol are covered by predicates, including manufacturer names, product versions, and quantitative measures.
Maintain Order and Structure: Organize the predicates in a logical order that reflects the sequence and relationships within the extraction protocol description.
Handle Quantitative Information: Explicitly capture all quantitative details such as RNA concentration, RNA Integrity Number (RIN), and ratios using the QuantitativeMeasure predicate.
Account for Platform-Specific Details: Include any platform-specific settings or details mentioned in the extraction protocol description.
Example Transformation

Extraction Protocol Description: "Blood was initially collected in sodium heparin-containing Vacutainer CPTTM cell separation tubes (Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ) to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells from other elements within 2 hours from blood draw. 
Subsequently, T cells were isolated with the anti-CD4 coated magnetic beads, respectively, using AutoMACs automated magnetic separation unit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). DNA and RNA were isolated from samples simultaneously using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Hilden, Germany)."

Transformed Predicates:
SampleType(Blood)
CollectionMethod(SodiumHeparinVacutainer)
CellSeparationMethod(AntiCD4CoatedMagneticBeads)
AutomatedUnitUsed(AutoMACs)
Manufacturer(MiltenyiBiotec, AutoMACs)
KitUsed(AllPrepDNARNAminiKit)
Manufacturer(Qiagen, AllPrepDNARNAminiKit)


Implementation Guidelines

Consistency: Ensure that similar extraction protocol descriptions yield consistent sets of predicates.
Accuracy: Accurately reflect the content and details of the extraction protocol description.
Comprehensiveness: Include all relevant information from the extraction protocol description.
Clarity: Maintain clear and understandable predicate expressions.


Error Handling

Missing Information: If certain details are missing from the extraction protocol description, note the omission and proceed with available information.
Ambiguities: In cases of ambiguity, apply the most likely predicate based on context and common practices."""
