Definition: QualityMetricCheck(metricCategory, metricValue)
Description: Represents a check or a threshold for a specific quality metric used in the data, such as read depth, base quality scores, alignment rates, or duplicate rates.
Example: QualityMetricCheck(ReadDepth, 30x)

Definition: DataFilteringCriterion(filterType, threshold)
Description: Documents the criteria used for filtering data, specifying the type of filtering applied and the threshold value. For example, it could detail criteria like removing reads with low quality scores.
Example: DataFilteringCriterion(QualityScore, 20)

Definition: BackgroundCorrectionMethod(method)
Description: Specifies the method used for correcting background noise in the quality control process.
Example: BackgroundCorrectionMethod(GenomeStudio)

Definition: DetectionPValueComputation(controlType, method)
Description: Describes how detection P-values are calculated during quality control, including the type of control and the computational method used.
Example: DetectionPValueComputation(NegativeControls, NeqcFunction)

Definition: NormalizationProcedure(method)
Description: Defines the method used for normalizing data as part of the quality control practices.
Example: NormalizationProcedure(QuantileNormalization)

Definition: SignalEstimationModel(method)
Description: Details the model used to estimate the signal within the data quality control process.
Example: SignalEstimationModel(NormalExponentialConvolution)

Definition: LogTransformation(application)
Description: Indicates whether a log transformation is applied to the data during the quality control process.
Example: LogTransformation(Enabled)

Definition: ControlProbeExclusion(action)
Description: Specifies whether control probe data is excluded from the normalized expression matrix during quality control.
Example: ControlProbeExclusion(Enabled)

Definition: OffsetAddition(valueDescription)
Description: Describes whether a small offset is added in data normalization processes as part of quality control.
Example: OffsetAddition(Small)

Definition: SoftwareVersion(softwareTitle, versionNumber)
Description: Details the version of the software used during the quality control and filtering process to standardize procedures.
Example: SoftwareVersion(AmbionTotalPrep, 5.0)
